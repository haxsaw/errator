1.  To build a local version of errator for testing:

    python setup[2|3].py build_ext --inplace

    (make sure to have cython installed). The proper setup*.py to use is based on the version
    of Python you are using to build the extension


2.  To build the wheel for distribution:

    python setup[2|3].py bdist_wheel --python-tag py[2|3]

    This will place the wheel in the dist subdirectory. The proper setup*.py to use is based on the version
    of Python you are using to build the extension


3.  To upload to test PyPI using twine:

    twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

    Run this from the project root directory.

    This will upload all the created distributions. This should include any distros from windows

4.  To upload to the real PyPI using twine:

    twine upload dist/*

    Run this from the project root directory.

    This will upload all the created distributions. This should include any distros from windows
